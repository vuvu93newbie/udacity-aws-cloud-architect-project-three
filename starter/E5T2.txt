# Identify tools that will allow you to do the following:

## Scan infrastructure as code templates
- For CloudFormation, there is:
    - Cfripper
    - Cloudsploit
    - cfn-lint

- For Terraform, there is:
    - Chef inspec
    - Regula
    - Terrascan

### Example vulnerability
- Misconfigured Security Groups: An IaC template might create a security group with overly permissive rules, such as allowing inbound traffic from any IP address on all ports3.

## Scan AMIâ€™s or containers for OS vulnerabilities
- Amazon Inspector

### Example vulnerability
- Outdated software packages: Amazon Inspector can identify which EC2 instaces or container images are running outdated software.

##Scan an AWS environment for cloud configuration vulnerabilities
- Amazon Config.

### Example vulnerability
- Public S3 Buckets: Misconfigured S3 buckets that are publicly accessible can expose sensitive data, leading to potential data breaches.
