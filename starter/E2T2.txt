Research and analyze which of the vulnerabilities appear to be related to the code that was deployed for the environment in this project.
1. AppLoadBalancer is not configured to redirect HTTP requests to HTTPS. (securityhub-alb-http-to-https-redirection-check-d18fe18d)
2. EC2 has public IP address. (securityhub-ec2-instance-no-public-ip-6bdc4284)
3. S3 Bucket doesn't has server access logging. (securityhub-s3-bucket-logging-enabled-dbd1710c)

Bonus - provide recommendations on how to remediate the vulnerabilities.
1. Limit traffic to ALB.
2. Move EC2 to private subnet.
3. Enable tracking access requests to S3 bucket.
