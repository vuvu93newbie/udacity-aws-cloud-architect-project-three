Based on the architecture diagram, and the steps you have taken so far to upload data and access the application web service, identify at least 2 obvious poor practices as it relates to security.  Include justification.

# Poor practice 1
WebAppSG 
- It permits ingress from port (22, 5000, 80). It should be 80 only.
- It also permits egress all traffic ip and port. It should be restricted to the RecipeWebServiceInstance ip and port 5000.


# Poor practice 2
RecipeWebServiceInstance
- It is using public subnet. AppLoadBalancer is in public already, so it can be in private subnet.

# Poor practice 3
S3BucketRecipesSecret
- Versioning disabled. We should turn it on.
- Encrypt disabled. We should turn it on.

# Poor practice 4
InstanceRolePolicy-C3
- It allow all action to S3. We should apply the least privileage principle.
